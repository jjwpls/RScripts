# RScripts

"simple_random_survey_simulation.github.R" simulates 100 simple random surveys and compares the distribution of the sample means to the true population total. This exercise is a buildiling block to be used for a more sophisticated simulation. 

"random_forest_vs_bagging.github.R" compares the testing errors (not out-of-bag errors) bewteen random forests and bagging. Note that bagging is a special case of random forests. 

"text_data_preprocessing.github.R" reads in txt files and pre-processes the text data for general text mining or text analysis.

"basic_descriptive_analysis.github.R" merges two datasets, recodes variables, plots variables, and tabulates one variable against antother.
